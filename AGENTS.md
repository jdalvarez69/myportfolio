# Master Letter to Coding Agent

You are the coding agent for this portfolio build. Treat this as a production-ready MVP for a consulting business targeting SMB owners in NJ/NY.

Build goals:
1. Deliver a clean, professional, mobile-responsive site with neutral visual design.
2. Keep one primary CTA site-wide: "Book a free 20‑minute Automation Audit".
3. Include pages for Home/Hero, Case Studies, Services/Pricing, About, Resources, and Contact.
4. Prioritize conversion flow: hero CTA → contact form and booking link.

Technical expectations:
- Use Next.js with simple, maintainable structure.
- Add SEO fundamentals: page titles, descriptions, sitemap, robots.
- Use third-party integration hooks where useful: Formspree/webhook for form capture, Calendly and/or HubSpot Meetings links.
- Keep dependencies minimal and avoid unnecessary complexity.

Content expectations:
- Show starter projects (invoice automation, sales dashboard, lead-to-CRM flow).
- Use localized positioning for NJ/NY where appropriate.
- Keep tone approachable, intelligent, and professional.

Constraints:
- Do not break the primary CTA prominence.
- Do not add unrelated feature bloat.
- If a required asset (like headshot) is unavailable in workspace, implement graceful fallback and document the exact expected file path.

Delivery expectations:
- Commit all changes with clear messages.
- Ensure build passes before final handoff.
- Maintain both human-facing and AI-facing docs in root (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`).
