# Agents: Portfolio CTO Strategy

## The Mandate

Deliver an engageable, professional portfolio that converts small-to-medium business owners (SMBs) into clients for automation, dashboards, and CRM/integration work — positioned to win monthly retainers and productized packages.

## The Tech Stack (Chosen tools and Why)

- Webflow or WordPress (marketing site): Fast, polished marketing site with low maintenance and easy content editing for non-technical clients.
- Next.js + Vercel (when scaling/custom features needed): Modern, SEO-friendly, server-side rendering, easy deployment and growth path to custom apps.
- Zapier / Make (integrations & automation): Rapidly build reliable automations and integrations without heavy backend work — ideal for demos and quick client wins.
- Google Sheets / Airtable (data & prototypes): Simple, shareable data stores for prototypes and many SMB workflows; low friction for clients.
- HubSpot (CRM) or Pipedrive: Easy-to-use CRM with free tiers and native integrations for lead flows and demos.
- Looker Studio / Metabase / Retool (dashboards & tools): Fast visual dashboards and internal tools to showcase analytics value to non-technical stakeholders.
- Supabase / PostgreSQL (production data): Lightweight, scalable DB option for when persistence beyond no-code is required.
- Node (Express) or Python (Flask/FastAPI) (APIs): Minimal backend for custom integrations, webhooks, or AI proxying when needed.
- GitHub (repos) + Vercel/Netlify (hosting): Simple CI/CD, reliable hosting, and professional code provenance for clients.
- OpenAI or hosted LLM APIs (AI features): Add intelligent assistants or automation enhancements with minimal front-end changes.

Why these choices:
- Speed to market: combine no-code (Webflow, Zapier) for demos and marketing with a clear upgrade path to code (Next.js, Node, Supabase).
- Client-friendly: tools chosen are familiar to SMBs, easy to demo, low-cost to run, and reduce buyer friction.
- Scalability: the stack supports growth from a single landing page and automations to custom apps and dashboards.
- Cost-effectiveness: minimizes hosting/maintenance costs early while enabling higher-value custom work later.

## The Sitemap (minimum viable pages)

- Home / Hero
  - One-line value proposition: who you help + specific outcome.
  - Subheadline: short list of services (Automation, Dashboards, CRM Integrations, AI Assistants).
  - Primary CTA: "Book a free 20‑minute Automation Audit" (see Non-Negotiables).
  - Social proof area (once available): logos, short quotes.
- Case Studies
  - 3–4 project pages: Problem → Your solution → Outcome/metrics → Demo/video → Tech used.
  - Each case study includes a clear CTA to book an audit or view pricing.
- Services / Pricing (productized packages)
  - Starter Pack (fixed-scope), Advanced Build, Monthly Retainer tiers.
  - Short bullets on deliverables, timelines, and starting price ranges.
- About
  - Short professional bio, approach, and why you focus on SMB automation.
- Resources / Lead Magnet
  - Downloadable "Automation Audit Checklist" PDF and short blog posts about automation wins.
- Contact / Lead-Gen Form
  - Simple form capturing name, company, email, website, brief description, and budget range.
  - Automated thank-you email and calendar-scheduling link.

## Non-Negotiables

- Mobile-responsiveness: All pages, demos, and dashboards must be responsive and usable on phones and tablets.
- Local SEO (NJ/NY): Each key landing page must include SEO-optimized keywords and localized content. Suggested keywords to start:
  - "automation services New Jersey"
  - "business automation NJ"
  - "CRM integration New Jersey"
  - "small business dashboard New Jersey"
  - "automation for small businesses NYC"
  - "sales dashboard NY"
  - Include city-targeted pages (e.g., Newark, Jersey City, Jersey Shore towns) as you expand.
- Clear CTA (single primary): Use this exact CTA text site-wide and in header buttons: "Book a free 20‑minute Automation Audit". Support with secondary CTAs: "See demo" and "Download checklist".

## Quick Pricing Guidance (starter ranges)

- Productized one-off builds: $300–$2,500 depending on scope (automations on the low end, CRM integrations and dashboards higher).
- Monthly retainers (maintenance/ongoing work): $200–$1,000/month to start.

## Next Actions

1. Build 3 starter projects (Invoice Automation, Sales Dashboard, Lead → CRM Flow) with short demo videos.  
2. Launch a simple Webflow or WordPress site with Home, Services, Case Studies, Resources, and Contact.  
3. Start local LinkedIn outreach with the free audit offer.
