Title: "Invoice Automation"
summary: "Auto-generate PDF invoices from Google Sheets."
---

Problem:
Small businesses spend hours creating and emailing invoices from spreadsheets.

Solution:
We built a Google Sheets + Zapier flow that auto-generates PDF invoices and emails them to clients. Admins update a single sheet; the system handles PDF generation, numbering, and sends receipts.

Outcome:
Demo workflow and sample data included. Time saved: estimated 4–8 hours/month for a small practice.
